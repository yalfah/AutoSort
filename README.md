This is a simple test repo project to walk through some ML training concept, the goal is to create an auto sorting trash bin that can auto sort items placed in its "sorting zone" into trash or recycle and trigger it to be "flushed" down into the correct bin.

The aim would be to use transfer learning to use an existing model then train it further on labelled images that depict viable trash and recycle items
